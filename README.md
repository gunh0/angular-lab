# Angular LAB

AngularJS is the first version of Angular, which was released in 2010. AngularJS is a JavaScript framework that allows you to build reusable HTML components and dynamic web applications.

Angular is the updated version of AngularJS, released in 2016. It is a complete rewrite of AngularJS, built with TypeScript and designed to be more efficient, powerful, and easier to use. Angular is a comprehensive JavaScript framework for building single-page applications (SPAs) and mobile applications. It provides a powerful set of features and tools for building modern web and mobile applications, including a command-line interface (CLI), dependency injection, and a powerful component-based architecture.

In general, Angular is a newer and more powerful framework than AngularJS, and it is recommended to use Angular for new projects. However, if you have an existing project built with AngularJS, you can continue to use AngularJS or migrate your project to Angular.

### Advantages of AngularJS over other JavaScript frameworks:

- **Dependency Injection:** Dependency Injection specifies a design pattern in which components are given their dependencies instead of hard coding them within the component.
- **Two way data binding:** AngularJS creates a two way data-binding between the select element and the orderProp model. orderProp is then used as the input for the orderBy filter.
- **Testing:** Angular JS is designed in a way that we can test right from the start. So, it is very easy to test any of its components through unit testing and end-to-end testing.
- **Model View Controller:** In Angular JS, it is very easy to develop application in a clean MVC way. You just have to split your application code into MVC components i.e. Model, View and the Controller.
- Directives, filters, modules, routes etc.
